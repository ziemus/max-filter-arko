# max-filter-arko
University project written in MIPS assembly language during my 4th semester of Computer Science at Warsaw University's of Technology Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology.
The filter requests 3 arguments, ie input BMP file name with directory, output BMP file and filter box size. Due to the restriction of not using dynamically allocated memory, it only works on images of width up to 1920 and calculates max box size given the width of the input image.
